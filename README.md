# ExcelMaster
ExcelMaster.ai, the Excel Copilot alternative that automates more complex formula, VBA and Python than Copilot and ChatGPT.

ExcelMaster.ai is the first AI to understand real world Excel structure, write and run code to extract data from PDFs, and solve complicated formula/VBA/Python/repetitive data processing tasks, far better than Copilot, ChatGPT and other "toy" AI bots.

With ChatGPT or Copilot, when you have complex structure that has merged cells or multiple regions in one sheet, the VBA code or Formula generated by these AI often have wrong assumptions for column headers. We have developed specialized algorithms to understand the complex struture then generate much more accurate formula and VBA with specialized models.
